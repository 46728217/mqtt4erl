#summary How to get the broker up and running

See Building to learn how to get the broker compiled.

 = From the erlang shell =

The broker is wrapped as an OTP application so it can be simply started with

{{{
application:start(mqtt_broker).
}}}

and stopped with:

{{{
application:stop(mqtt_broker).
}}}


Remember to get the {{{beam}}} files onto your path, for example by invoking the shell as
{{{
erl -pa ./ebin
}}}

 = From the command line =

Specify the broker's bootfile when you invoke erlang on the command line, eg:

{{{
erl -noshell -boot mqtt_broker_0.3.0
}}}

See Building for clues on getting the boot files built.
