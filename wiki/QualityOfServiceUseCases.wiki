Some use cases to understand how quality of service levels should affect behaviour of MQTT clients and brokers.

= Client =
== QOS 0 - zero or more deliveries ==
== QOS 1 - one or more deliveries ==
== QOS 2 - exactly one delivery ==

= Broker =
== QOS 0 - zero or more deliveries ==
=== Normal Flow ===
 * client sends a QoS 0 message

== QOS 1 - one or more deliveries ==
=== Normal Flow ===
 * client sends a QoS 1 message (PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE) and stores in Persistent Outbox
 * client receives {PUB,SUB,UNSUB}ACK and removes message from Outbox

=== Death before Acknowledgement ===
 * client sends a QoS 1 message (PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE) and stores in Persistent Outbox
 * client dies before {PUB,SUB,UNSUB}ACK received 
 * client restarts with same client id and recovers Persistent Outbox
 * client messages in Outbox
 * client receives {PUB,SUB,UNSUB}ACK and removes message from Outbox

== QOS 2 - exactly one delivery ==
