Some use cases to understand how quality of service levels should affect behaviour of MQTT clients and brokers.

= Client =
== QOS 0 - zero or more deliveries ==
== QOS 1 - one or more deliveries ==
== QOS 2 - exactly one delivery ==

= Broker =
== QOS 0 - zero or more deliveries ==



== QOS 1 - one or more deliveries ==
=== Death before {P,SUB,UNSUB}UBACK ===
 * client sends a QoS 1 message
 * client dies
 * client restarts with same client id
 * client recovers unacknowledged message and resends until acknowledged

== QOS 2 - exactly one delivery ==
