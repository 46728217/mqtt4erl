Some use cases to understand how quality of service levels should affect behaviour of MQTT clients and brokers.

= Client =
== QOS 0 - zero or more deliveries ==
== QOS 1 - one or more deliveries ==
== QOS 2 - exactly one delivery ==

= Broker =
== QOS 0 - zero or more deliveries ==
== QOS 1 - one or more deliveries ==
== QOS 2 - exactly one delivery ==
